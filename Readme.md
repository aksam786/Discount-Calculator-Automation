# installing dependencies

To install dependencies, run this command:

1. Run `npm install` - this will read the `package.json` to create a list of dependencies and then use `package-lock.json` to install specific versions of these dependencies, if they exist.

## Running tests

Run `npx playwright test` to execute the tests
